# RxLens

RxLens is a prototype system that analyzes prescriptions written using branded medicines and maps them to their underlying salt compositions and generic equivalents.

The project focuses on **prescription-level analysis**, treating a list of medicines as a single unit to identify duplicate salts and composition-equivalent alternatives.
